# Burger

Welcome to my Burger ordering app!

-To get started, Enter in any type of burger that you would like to order, Select if this is an "order" of if this has already been "eaten" (we loose track of the burgers for some reason, its like someone is stealling them!)
-Once you have ordered your burger, it will go into the "Ordered Burgers" list. From here you can either remove the burger with the "No More!" button or let us know that you have eaten the burger. 
-When you have Eaten or burger or if you have selected "Already Eaten!" when creating the order, your burger will show up in the "Served Burgers" list. Don't worry, if your burger is Served but you didn't eat it, Simply select the "Delicious, order another!" button and we will get another one going for you.

-When you are done with the burger or if you did not like it, feel free to choose the "No More!" button and we will remove the burger altogether.

Thank you for coming by and Hope that you come again.......now about those missing burgers.
